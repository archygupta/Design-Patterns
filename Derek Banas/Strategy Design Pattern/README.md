Here is my Strategy design patterns tutorial. You use this pattern if you need to dynamically change an algorithm used by an object at run time. Don’t worry, just watch the video and you’ll get it.

The pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses. It is a super design pattern and is often the first one taught.

A Strategy Pattern says that "defines a family of functionality, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable".

The Strategy Pattern is also known as Policy.

Benefits:
It provides a substitute to subclassing.
It defines each behavior within its own class, eliminating the need for conditional statements.
It makes it easier to extend and incorporate new behavior without changing the application.
Usage:
When the multiple classes differ only in their behaviors.e.g. Servlet API.
It is used when you need different variations of an algorithm.

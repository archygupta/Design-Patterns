An Observer Pattern says that "just define a one-to-one dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically".

The Memento pattern is also known as Dependents or Publish-Subscribe.

Benefits:
It describes the coupling between the objects and the observer.
It provides the support for broadcast-type communication.
Usage:
When the change of a state in one object must be reflected in another object without keeping the objects tight coupled.
When the framework we writes and needs to be enhanced in future with new observers with minimal chamges.

The Observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject (Publisher), maintains a list of its dependents,
called observers (Subscribers), and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
